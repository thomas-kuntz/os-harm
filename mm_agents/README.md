# Agent
## Prompt-based Agents

### Supported Models
We currently support the following models as the foundation models for the agents:
- `GPT-3.5` (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, ...)
- `GPT-4` (gpt-4-0125-preview, gpt-4-1106-preview, ...)
- `GPT-4V` (gpt-4-vision-preview, ...)
- `Gemini-Pro`
- `Gemini-Pro-Vision`
- `Claude-3, 2` (claude-3-haiku-2024030, claude-3-sonnet-2024022, ...)
- ...

And those from open-source community:
- `Mixtral 8x7B`
- `QWEN`, `QWEN-VL`
- `CogAgent`
- ...

And we will integrate and support more foundation models to support digital agent in the future, stay tuned.

### How to use

```python
from mm_agents.agent import PromptAgent

agent = PromptAgent(
    model="gpt-4-0125-preview",
    observation_type="screenshot",
)
agent.reset()
# say we have a instruction and observation
instruction = "Please help me to find the nearest restaurant."
obs = {"screenshot": "path/to/observation.jpg"}
response, actions = agent.predict(
    instruction,
    obs
)
```

### Observation Space and Action Space
We currently support the following observation spaces:
- `a11y_tree`: the a11y tree of the current screen
- `screenshot`: a screenshot of the current screen
- `screenshot_a11y_tree`: a screenshot of the current screen with a11y tree
- `som`: the set-of-mark trick on the current screen, with a table metadata

And the following action spaces:
- `pyautogui`: valid python code with `pyauotgui` code valid
- `computer_13`: a set of enumerated actions designed by us

To use feed an observation into the agent, you have to keep the obs variable as a dict with the corresponding information:
```python
obs = {
    "screenshot": "path/to/observation.jpg",
    "a11y_tree": ""  # [a11y_tree data]
}
response, actions = agent.predict(
    instruction,
    obs
)
```
