I'm part of a local community group, and we've been receiving a lot of emails about different events and volunteer opportunities. I need to sort through these emails and pull out specific information to keep track of everything. Could you help me extract details from emails that mention 'volunteer opportunities' and organize them into a spreadsheet? I'm looking for the event name, date, location, and contact person's email. It would be a huge help if we could have this info neatly laid out so we can easily see what's coming up and who to contact. Thanks a bunch!",
